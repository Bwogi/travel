# Project Notes

Reacts - Cleaning up a React project

1. delete /src folder
2. recreate /src folder
3. create an /src/index.js file
   1. import React from 'react'
   2. import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
   3. import App from './App'
   4. ReactDom.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
4. in the public folder, delete all files except index.html
5. create an /src/App.js file. Initialise it then run npm start to run the react app.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CssBaseline, Grid } from '@material-ui/core';
import Header from './components/Header/Header';
import List from './components/List/List';
import Map from './components/Map/Map';
import PlaceDetails from './components/PlaceDetails/PlaceDetails';

const App = () => {
	return (
		<>
			{/* to reset the margins and padding use CssBaseline first */}
			<CssBaseline />
			<Header />
			{/* here we have a grid of type container with a spacing of 3 and 100% width inline style */}
			<Grid container spacing={3} style={{ width: '100%' }}>
				{/* inside this we will have one more grid of type item and it will take all 12 spaces(full width) on mobile devices but on medium devices or larger, it will taks 4 spaces */}
				<Grid item xs={12} md={4}>
					<List />
				</Grid>
				{/* the map is going to take 8 spaces on medium or larger devices */}
				<Grid item xs={12} md={8}>
					<Map />
				</Grid>
			</Grid>
		</>
	);
};

export default App;
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
